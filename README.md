# phase_2_group_4
Group project for phase 2 DS


Our stakeholder is a property investor/redeveloper hoping to purchase and update properties.
For the sake of this experiment, this developer is considering scraping the existing buildings.
With this in mind, the developer is interested in both underlying values of the property and the
more mutable properties. This developer is looking for a mismatch, where a property might have
a high underlying value but other characteristics that aren't optimized. Finally, the developer 
would want to know how to then optimize the property once it has been purchased.

#### The following characteristics are being considered as 'fixed':

Zipcode, view, waterfront, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15, lat and long, sqft_lot

#### The following characteristics are being considered as 'fixable':

bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, floors, sqft_above, grade

Our exploration in the model will attempt to tease these factors apart in order to help guide our analysis.

#### The first iteration

The first iteration of the model takes in a whole lot of data, including the zipcodes, which we've discovered have a huge predictive effect. This leads to a very high R-squared, but not a lot of useful analysis.
